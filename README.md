These files are my reworked solutions (using the course solutions) to the exercises found in Launch School's Introduction to Programming 
with JavaScript and in the JavaScript Basics exercises at the end of the LS JS100 (prep) course.
These solutions are for my reference and to build on later concepts.
I spent many hours working and reworking these solutions, until I understood them as explained in the text.
The beginning of each file name is the name of the chapter. 
For the JavaScript Basics exercises, these solutions are all named js100_
